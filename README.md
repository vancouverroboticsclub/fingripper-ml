## Fingripper FreeCAD files

4 models of [Festo's FinGripper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pHuEM4hTxU), not the real thing but as good as I could make them. 2 models are 30mm wide and 2 are 20mm wide.

I had the 20mm versions printed by Shapeways in their [Elasto Plastic material](http://www.shapeways.com/materials/elasto-plastic?li=nav). At the time I didn't know how stiff the material was - hence a solid and a lighter version. The holes for the linkages could be bigger and/or I had to get them unklogged, other than that I'm quite happy with them.
For the linkages I used steel rods (also called music wire) from a hoppy shop.

I'm using the 20mm solid version on my robot to collect empty cans.
